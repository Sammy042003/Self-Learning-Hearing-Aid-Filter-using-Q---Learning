A noisy speech corpus (NOIZEUS) was developed to facilitate comparison of speech enhancement algorithms among research groups. The noisy database contains 30 IEEE sentences (produced by three male and three female speakers) corrupted by eight different real-world noises at different SNRs. The noise was taken from the AURORA database and includes suburban train noise, babble, car, exhibition hall, restaurant, street, airport and train-station noise.
